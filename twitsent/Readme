twitsent was a college project I wrote back when Twitter had an open and free API.

It retrieves recent tweets using an input search term and runs them through a sentiment
classification model, returning the data in a nice user interface showing the general sentiment
of Twitter users on the given topic. The user interface also shows some example tweets and
their classification, and allows you to input text of your own to text the classification model.
