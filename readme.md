This repository contains a collection of my past personal & side projects for
review. You can read a summary of each by opening the folder and viewing the
readme.md.

The code in these is mixed in terms of quality because they're just personal
projects; a lot of them are throwaway-ish for educational purposes, and several
of them were college projects. When I write code professionally, I hold my work
to a much higher standard.
