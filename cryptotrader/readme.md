cryptotrader was a project I built during college for a class assignment.

The project downloads trading cryptocurrency data from a trading API that offered
historical data for free, trained a small RNN on it, outputs predictions of future
trades, and had a half-finished web interface for visualizing the historical data
alongside the outputted predicted trades that it would have made on the historical dataset.
