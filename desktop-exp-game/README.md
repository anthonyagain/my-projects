desktop-exp-game is a toy project that I built for productivity tracking.

It runs entirely on your local machine, as a small always-on-top window using
electron, so you can view it on the left or right side of your screen, and you
can press a button to start & end a work session. While a work session is ongoing,
the application tracks for you how long you've been working for, and allows you
to input your goal tasks for the work session and mark them as completed once you're
done.

The gimmick of the app is that depending on how long you work and how many tasks you
completed, after you finish working, you gain "EXP" as if you were in a Pokemon battle.
Over time, you can level up your character from having been consistently productive and
view all the progress you've made.
